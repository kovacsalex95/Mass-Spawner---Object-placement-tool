1.3.2:
---------------------
Fixes:
- Fixed transform reference link issue on object layer duplication


1.3.1:
---------------------
Fixes:
- Fixed Heightmap gizmo:
  Now the World boundary box drawing properly

- Fixed GUILayout inconsistencies

- Fixed several Object reference errors


1.3.0:
---------------------
Changes:
- Tab view:
  The "Heightmap" and "World" tabs merged as "Heightmap & World".
  The "Layers" tab is now called "Layers & Objects", and it contains now the placement commands and the heightmap preview.
  The "Place/Update objects" and "Delete objects" button only visible in the "Layers & Objects" tab.

Fixes:
- Heightmaps stored correctly:
  Earlier the generated maps (height, steepness, stylized) got discarded when the you close the editor.
  From now on, the maps saved into the Asset's folder (as "generatedMaps"), and the editor load them from this asset when you start the editor.

- Layer duplication:
  Now the layer duplication is working perfectly, without unwanted reference chaining or data loss.

Improvements
- Overall Editor performace:
  The Editor script got a lot of optimization, now the editor is blazing fast.

- Placement maps:
  The placement maps now generated with a compute shader for better performance (up to 10X).

- Gizmos:
  Now the gizmos only showen when needed to. (World bounds, Placement)

- Icons:
  Reworked button icons for better visibility in dark UI mode.

Features:
- Placement organicity:
  We have a new slider called "Placement organicity". This value can be changed to adjust how "organic" you want your placement to be.

- Placement methods:
  We have 2 different methods for placement now. The Instantiate is the old one, and the Prefab option will keep the prefab connection
  with the cost of disabled coloring options.

- Heightmap preview:
  You can zoom an pan the preview now.


1.2.0:
---------------------
Changes:
- Layer's material coloring "name" property behaviour:
  If you delete the name property, the script will fill up with the default shader's color property name.
  This can be handy if you switch rendering pipeline after the layers created. You just need to clear the property name, and you will get the correct one!

Features:
- Render Pipeline independence:
  Now the editor preview generated with a compute shader, so now this package is independent from the render pipeline.
  You can use it with the Standard RP, or URP, HDRP. Even with a custom Render Pipeline!


1.1.0:
---------------------
Changes:
- Object layers:
  "Placement rarity" is now called "Placement density" and works in the opposite way. Bigger values means more objects.

Fixes:
- The icons will load even if you move the MassSpawner to another folder

Improvements:
- Documentation improvements
- Better performance preview gizmos
- Better labels for color group input fields (RGB/HSV instead of XYZ)

Features:
- URP Editor support:
  You can now use this tool in URP projects as well
