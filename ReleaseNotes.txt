1.2.0:
---------------------
Changes:
- Layer's material coloring "name" property behaviour:
  If you delete the name property, the script will fill up with the default shader's color property name.
  This can be handy if you switch rendering pipeline after the layers created. You just need to clear the property name, and you will get the correct one!

Features:
- Render Pipeline independence:
  Now the editor preview generated with a compute shader, so now this package is independent from the render pipeline.
  You can use it with the Standard RP, or URP, HDRP. Even with a custom Render Pipeline!


1.1.0:
---------------------
Changes:
- Object layers:
  "Placement rarity" is now called "Placement density" and works in the opposite way. Bigger values means more objects.

Fixes:
- The icons will load even if you move the MassSpawner to another folder

Improvements:
- Documentation improvements
- Better performance preview gizmos
- Better labels for color group input fields (RGB/HSV instead of XYZ)

Features:
- URP Editor support:
  You can now use this tool in URP projects as well
